  activity_description: "Examination and analysis of sustainable Prairie cropping systems. Emphasis will be placed on systems that optimize the benefits of crop rotation, integrate crops and livestock, conserve soil and water resources, and enhance biodiversity. Current, historical, and emerging crop production systems from the Prairies and other regions of the world will be discussed. Includes experiential learning through farm interviews and/or field tours and/or guest speakers. May not be held with PLNT 3510.
PR/CR: A minimum grade of C is required unless otherwise indicated.
Mutually Exclusive: PLNT 3510"
